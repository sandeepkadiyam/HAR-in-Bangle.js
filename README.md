# HAR-in-Bangle.js

## Abstract
Human Activity Recognition(HAR) on edge devices such as wearables is proven to have lower latency and better performance when compared to the activity recognition performed on a cloud server. HAR using deep learning algorithms is claimed to have a high performance and accuracy. However, the edge devices are resource-constrained and cannot support high computation, which makes it impossible to deploy the state of art deep learning models on to them. One solution to this problem is to use the open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, TensorFlow lite which helps in converting deep learning models to edge device compatible models and perform on device inference. This framework can also be used to do on-device inference.This project aims to adapt the already existing Gesture recognition for Human activity recognition in the Bangle.JS smartwatches. The activity recognition is performed using the sensor data from the Accelerometer. A light weight deep learning model is used to classify the activities. This report explains about organizing sensor data, developing deep learning model, deployment and the on-device inference of the model on bangle.JS smartwatch in detail.
